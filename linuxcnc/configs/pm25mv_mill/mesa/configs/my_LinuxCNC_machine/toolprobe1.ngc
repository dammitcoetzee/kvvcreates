; The G38 variants used below will stop execution and display an error message if probing is not
; successful. Alternatively, one could use the non-error-signaling varieties and check #5070, which
; will be 1 after probing is successful and otherwise 0.

; Probe towards the tool length sensor, slow enough that machine can stop within travel of sensor.
G38.2 F[200/25.4] Z-1

; Probe away from tool length sensor, slower, in the same direction that home was probed, to minimize error from backlash.

M65 P0 ; Turn off air blast

G90 ; Absolute mode

; Calculate and save the length of tool 1.
; 0 is the distance from home to the nose of spindle touching off tool length sensor.
; #32 is the Z position in current coordinate system in which toolprobe0 was executed at Z=0.
; #5063 is Z position in the coordinate system in which G38 was executed.

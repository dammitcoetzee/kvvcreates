o<toolprobe1> SUB

; This subroutine probes the length of the tool, passed as parameter #1.
; The tool length is calculated, saved, and the offset activated.

#<tls_tool>=#1 ; Tool to measure

; The following are initialized in toolprobe0.ngc
; #<_tls_home_z>=#5422       ; Machine Z-coordinate at home position
; #<_tls_ref_len>            ; Reference length (nose of spindle)
; #<_tls_s_metric>=#<_metric>
; #<_tls_s_absolute>=#<_absolute>

G17 ; XY plane
G20 ; Inches
G40 ; Cancel tool radius compensation
G49 ; Cancel tool length compensation
G80 ; Cancel canned cycle
G94 ; Units / min feedrate

G91 ; Incremental mode

T#<tls_tool> M6

M5 M9 ; Turn off spindle and coolant.
M64 P0 ; Turn on air blast

; The G38 variants used below will stop execution and display an error 
; message if probing is not successful. Alternatively, one could use the
; non-error-signaling varieties and check #5070, which will be 1 after
; probing is successful and otherwise 0. That would provide a means to
; turn off the air blast on an error.

; Probe towards the tool length sensor, slow enough that machine can
; stop within travel of sensor. Tool length maximum approach speed
; from specification is 200mm/min.
G38.2 F[200/25.4] Z-1

M65 P0 ; Turn off air blast

G4 P0.5 ; Short delay to settle motion. Necessary with path blending?

; Probe away from tool length sensor slowly, in the same direction
; that home was probed, to minimize backlash error.
G38.4 F[10/25.4] Z1

G90 ; Absolute mode

; Calculate absolute probe position.
; #5063 is Z position in the coordinate system in which G38 was executed.
; From https://forum.linuxcnc.org/20-g-code/35746-how-to-save-machine-coordinates-with-tool-length-compensation#123021
#<abs_probed_z_pos> = [#[5203 + [20 * #5220]] + #5063]

; Calculate and save the length of the selected tool. The length is calculated
; using the probed position of the reference (the spindle nose) and the probed
; position of the current tool. The difference, in machine coordinates, is the
; current tool's length.
; #<tls_tool_length> = [#<_tls_ref_len> + #<_tls_home_z> + #<abs_probed_z_pos>]
#<tls_tool_length> = [#<_tls_ref_len> + #<abs_probed_z_pos>]
